//! The audit log: who did what, recorded where the write happened.
//!
//! Bullet Train shipped audit logs as a Pro module; here they are framework
//! plumbing, on the same terms outgoing webhooks are. [`record`] writes one row
//! through the caller's own connection, so an audit event commits with the
//! write that caused it and a rolled-back write leaves nothing behind. Nothing
//! in the framework updates or deletes a row, and no endpoint offers either:
//! the log is append-only, which is the only property that makes it evidence.
//!
//! # Recording
//!
//! A handler picks up the ambient facts with the [`Context`] extractor, names
//! the actor, and hands both to [`record`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async fn rename_team(
//!     member: TeamMember,
//!     context: audit::Context,
//!     Json(body): Json<NameBody>,
//! ) -> Result<impl IntoResponse, ApiError> {
//!     // ... perform the rename ...
//!     audit::record(
//!         &mut connection,
//!         &context.by(&member.user),
//!         &audit::Event::new(audit::TEAM_RENAMED, "Team")
//!             .team(member.team.id)
//!             .subject(member.team.id)
//!             .label(&name)
//!             .changes(Changes::new().field("name", old_name, name.clone())),
//!     )
//!     .await?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # What a row says
//!
//! `action` is the verb. A scaffolded model records the bare lifecycle action
//! (`created`, `updated`, `destroyed`) and names itself in `subject_type`; the
//! framework's own surfaces record a dotted verb, and every one of them is a
//! constant in this module ([`TEAM_RENAMED`], [`MEMBER_ROLE_CHANGED`], and so
//! on).
//!
//! `team_id` and `organization_id` say where the act happened, and at most one
//! of them is set: a team-level act names its team, an organization-level act
//! names its organization, and an account-level act such as a password change
//! names neither, because it happens outside every tenant the account belongs
//! to.
//!
//! `actor_name` and `subject_label` are copied rather than joined. A log that
//! renders "(deleted user)" where a name belongs has lost the answer it exists
//! to give, so the row keeps how both read at the moment they were written.
//!
//! # Secrets
//!
//! [`Changes`] never carries one, and not because anything strips it
//! afterwards. A scaffolded model's change set is computed by
//! [`Changes::between`] from the serialized record, which is the same shape the
//! REST API answers with and so holds nothing secret to begin with; the
//! framework's own credential events record an empty change set, because the
//! fact that a password changed is the whole of what an auditor needs and the
//! password is not.
//!
//! # Reading
//!
//! [`router`] serves the team-scoped listing at
//! `/teams/{team_id}/audit-events`, gated on the admin role, and the caller's
//! own account events at `/audit-events`. Applications mount it under
//! `/account`. See `docs/audit.md`.

/// # Errors
