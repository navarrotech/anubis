//! Ownership-chain authorization guards.
//!
//! Handlers opt into tenancy enforcement by taking a guard extractor as an
//! argument. [`TeamMember`] resolves the route's `{team_id}` against the
//! signed-in user's membership; [`OrganizationMember`] does the same for
//! `{organization_id}`, and [`SubTenantMember`] for `{sub_tenant_id}`.
//! Extraction rejects before the handler body runs: `401` when not signed in,
//! `404` when the target does not exist *or* the user is not a member
//! (identical responses, so probing ids reveals nothing).
//!
//! Every guard honors a suspension, which is a deny rather than a missing
//! grant: a suspended organization membership closes every tenant in the
//! organization, and a suspended sub-tenant membership closes that sub-tenant
//! and the teams scoped to it. The rule and its reasoning live with
//! [`anubis::tenancy::resolve_sub_tenant_access`], which is the one place that
//! resolves sub-tenant access.
//!
//! [`anubis::tenancy::resolve_sub_tenant_access`]: crate::tenancy::resolve_sub_tenant_access
//!
//! Permissions come from the compiled role set: `member.require(action,
//! model)` answers `403` unless one of the membership's roles grants the
//! action. Scaffolded models resolve their parent chain to the owning team
//! and ride the same primitives.
//!
//! Routers using these extractors provide two request extensions, which
//! [`layer`] bundles:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let app = Router::new()
//!     .route("/teams/{team_id}/projects", get(list_projects))
//!     .layer(anubis::guard::layer(pool, role_set));
//!
//! async fn list_projects(member: TeamMember) -> Result<..., ApiError> {
//!     member.require(Action::Read, "Project")?;
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
