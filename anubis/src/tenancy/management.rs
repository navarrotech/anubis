//! Tenancy management: creating, renaming, and dissolving tenants.
//!
//! These routes merge into the tenancy router (conventionally under
//! `/tenancy`) and make the tenancy surface manageable rather than
//! invite-only:
//!
//! | Route | Guard | Effect |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `POST /organizations` | signed in | Create an organization with its default team |
//! | `PATCH /organizations/{organization_id}` | org admin | Rename the organization |
//! | `DELETE /organizations/{organization_id}` | org admin | Delete the organization and everything under it |
//! | `POST /organizations/{organization_id}/teams` | org admin | Create a team, with the creator as its admin |
//! | `DELETE /organizations/{organization_id}/teams/{team_id}` | org admin | Delete a team and its records |
//! | `PUT /organizations/{organization_id}/teams/{team_id}/sub-tenants` | org admin | Replace which sub-tenants the team reaches |
//! | `GET /organizations/{organization_id}/sub-tenants` | org member | The sub-tenants the caller reaches |
//! | `POST /organizations/{organization_id}/sub-tenants` | org admin | Create a sub-tenant |
//! | `PATCH /organizations/{organization_id}/sub-tenants/{sub_tenant_id}` | org admin | Rename a sub-tenant |
//! | `DELETE /organizations/{organization_id}/sub-tenants/{sub_tenant_id}` | org admin | Delete a sub-tenant and its records |
//! | `DELETE /organizations/{organization_id}/members/{membership_id}` | org admin | Remove an organization member |
//! | `POST /organizations/{organization_id}/leave` | org member | Leave the organization |
//! | `DELETE /organizations/{organization_id}/invitations/{invitation_id}` | org admin | Revoke any pending invitation in the organization |
//! | `PATCH /teams/{team_id}` | team admin | Rename the team |
//! | `PATCH /teams/{team_id}/members/{membership_id}` | team admin | Change a member's roles |
//! | `DELETE /teams/{team_id}/members/{membership_id}` | team admin | Remove a member |
//! | `POST /teams/{team_id}/leave` | team member | Leave the team |
//! | `DELETE /teams/{team_id}/invitations/{invitation_id}` | team admin | Revoke a pending team invitation |
//!
//! Two invariants run through all of it, and `docs/tenancy.md` states them in
//! full.
//!
//! A tenant always keeps at least one claimed admin, so the last one cannot be
//! demoted, removed, or walk out: those answer `409 Conflict`, because the
//! request is well formed and only the current state refuses it. Every
//! membership change runs inside a transaction that locks the tenant's own row
//! first ([`lock_team`]), and any change that takes the admin role off a real
//! person ([`stepped_down`]) counts the survivors before committing. Ordering
//! is what makes the count mean anything: two admins acting at the same
//! instant would otherwise each read the other as the one who remains, and
//! both would commit.
//!
//! Deletion cascades: the framework's foreign keys, and the ones the
//! scaffolder generates, are `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `teams` and
//! `organizations`, so deleting a tenant deletes the records that chain to it.
//! An application that declares its own restricting foreign key gets a `409`
//! instead of a broken delete.
