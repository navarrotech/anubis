//! Who reaches a sub-tenant, and with which roles.
//!
//! A user can reach a sub-tenant along four paths, and this module is the one
//! place that reconciles them. Two call sites that each worked the rules out
//! for themselves would eventually disagree about who may read something, and
//! a disagreement between two authorization paths is a data leak, so every
//! caller resolves through [`resolve_sub_tenant_access`] and none re-derives
//! it. The [`SubTenantMember`](crate::guard::SubTenantMember) guard is the
//! first caller; application handlers are the rest.
//!
//! # The rules
//!
//! **A suspension is a deny.** It is checked before any grant and it outranks
//! every one of them, the organization admin's bypass included: a deny an
//! admin bit silently ignored would not be a deny. A suspended organization
//! membership cuts the member out of every sub-tenant in the organization; a
//! suspended sub-tenant membership cuts them out of that one.
//!
//! Otherwise a grant applies when:
//!
//! 1. **The caller administers the organization.** An admin bypasses the
//!    tier and reaches every sub-tenant in it.
//! 2. **The caller is a full organization member.** Their standing cascades
//!    into every sub-tenant. A guest's does not: a guest reaches only what
//!    they were granted by name, which is the whole point of the distinction.
//! 3. **The caller holds a membership in this sub-tenant.** This is the
//!    explicit grant, and it applies to full members and guests alike, since
//!    it can only add.
//! 4. **The caller belongs to a team that reaches this sub-tenant.** A team
//!    scoped `organization` reaches every sub-tenant in it, the ones created
//!    after the team included; a team scoped `explicit` reaches exactly the
//!    ones it holds a `team_sub_tenants` grant for, and never leaks to
//!    another. A team membership grants reach whatever the member's
//!    organization access says, because putting somebody on a team is itself
//!    the explicit act: an administrator confining a guest to one sub-tenant
//!    scopes their team to it rather than leaving it organization-wide.
//!
//! The resolved role set is the **union** of every applying grant's roles.
//! Permission is monotone in the role set ([`RoleSet::can`] asks whether *any*
//! held role grants the action), so the union is exactly the strongest
//! standing the caller holds across the tiers.
//!
